							<h3>Database project - Course Project</h3>
							<h4>SQL, E-R diagram</h4>
							<p>On the Oracle platform, I successfully utilized SQL to build a comprehensive library information management system, focusing on centralized storage of detailed customer and book information. Through careful design of the entity-relationship diagram, I defined the relationships and their attributes, ensuring database consistency through normalization techniques. The system includes specially designed views for various scenarios, such as displaying books with low inventory and tracking customer information for overdue book returns. This system not only provides efficient data management but also boasts excellent flexibility to meet diverse library management needs, delivering outstanding library services to users.</p>

							<h3>Data analysis project - Course Project</h3>
							<h4>Python, Pandas, Anaconda</h4>
							<p>This project delves into the critical health challenge of cancer, specifically focusing on breast cancer. By leveraging data analysis, the project aims to develop streamlined classification models using minimal variables to predict Malignant or Benign breast cancer types. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, comprises 569 instances with 32 geometric parameter columns. Noteworthy techniques employed include preliminary feature selection based on correlation values exceeding 0.9, normalization using MinMaxScaler for K-NN sensitivity, and model implementation with Logistic Regression and K-NN. Despite encountering challenges in Logistic Regression convergence, the project successfully establishes models with over 0.95 accuracy. The application can be extended to clinical settings for cost-effective cancer-type prediction.</p>

							<h3>Web server project - Personal Project</h3>
							<h4>C, WinSock2</h4>
							<p>This C-based Web server project utilizing WinSock2 extensively showcases my expertise in network programming. Leveraging WinSock2, it achieves functionalities such as client connection monitoring, HTTP request parsing, static file serving, and CGI script execution. To enhance concurrent performance, I adopted a multi-threading model, creating independent threads for each client connection to handle requests. The project introduces anonymous pipes for inter-process communication, enabling bidirectional communication with CGI scripts written in C. This allows the server to pass POST requests to CGI scripts and receive processed results. Throughout the development process, I prioritized error handling, thread safety, and implemented basic security checks for incoming requests. Ultimately, I crafted a personal profile website using HTML and employed port forwarding technology, enabling users across the internet to access my resume website.</p>

							<h3>Deep learning project - Dissertation</h3>
							<h4>Python, Keras</h4>
							<p>This project is centered around generating complete melodies based on a given set of notes as the seed. Leveraging the symbolic representation of melody, it is treated as time-series data. Considering the inherent properties of melodies involving short and long-term repetitions, the generation process can be conceptualized as predicting the next data point in the time series given the current sequence. To address this, I employed an RNN-LSTM model capable of capturing the intricate repetitive patterns present in melodies. The use of one-hot encoding facilitated efficient data processing. Moreover, I adopted an unconventional approach by representing intervals using a two-dimensional vector instead of individual notes. This innovative choice aimed to explore uncharted territories in melody generation. Through rigorous training, the model successfully learned to generate melodies reminiscent of Chopin's compositions.</p>
